# RavenDB-Robo-Driver
A Robo Driver for editing JSON files through the RavenDB database browser GUI

## Description
Primarilly utilising the Selenium Python library, this is a proof of concept of the ability to make edits to JSON files stored on RavenDB using a robo-driver. The purpose of this is as a workaround for when a database admin might want to automate or make user accessible, edits to the database. RavenDB lacks robust out of the box API controls so this is an alternative solution to developing in house API's to control the DB. 

## Why so many comments?

It is aggressively overcommented because it is meant to be understood and edited by people who may or may not have extensive python experience.
